The Physics Behind pyXSIM
=========================

If you don't care to know or already know how X-ray emission from astrophysical sources works, and just want to get
started, you can skip to :ref:`installing`.

From Source to Detector: Three Basic Steps
------------------------------------------

Limitations
-----------

Given the above framework, pyXSIM currently has the following limitations, which may or may not be 
lifted in the future: 

* pyXSIM is currently unable to simulate any sources with any optical thickness, absorption, or scattering.
* pyXSIM is currently unable to simulate any sources with explicit time dependence.
